# [Project 1: COVID 19 Death Analysis](https://dishaprateechee.github.io/COVID-19-Analysis/)

This is a project I did to analyse the deaths that occurred due to COVID-19 based on the available data set.

* Data was taken from the Kaggle dataset.
* This is an attempt to analyse the given data on COVID-19 death and recovery toll to figure how better to cater to the individuals affected by it.
* The below analysis can help determine the priority of the health care that need to be provided to an individual based on different parameters.
* The Project Write-up is published on [MyGithubProfile](https://github.com/DishaPrateechee/COVID-19-Analysis)
